Glorious Nation Internet Simulator

This project started as a way to explore the idea of internet censorship in Western countries such as China. This topic was interesting to me and it seems more and more relevant with events such as COVID-19 where China was accused of suppressing the number of infected patients and only showing their population the positive events during this crisis, thus swaying the narrative of the event. Another recent event was the controversy with Animal Crossing, where Chinese president, Xi Jinping was portrayed in an insulting manner and comments on the protests in Hong Kong were posted, which is resulted in a ban on the game and a push for a ban on online communication in video games.

I wanted to have the player feel like something is off during the playthrough, as if the wool is being pulled over their eyes, but not have the websites feel necessarily menacing (until the very end). 

I also wanted to include various Easter eggs, such as the name of the internet browser being “Naenara”, a browser used in North Korea, another country known for its heavy censorship.
A feature I wanted to implement was to have the pages change at a certain point, to have the truth revealed towards the end, and show the player that things aren’t what they seemed. This was done through a “VPN” service which can only be accessed with an official’s login information on a hidden government website, as common folk aren’t meant to access the truth.
After the VPN is turned on, Google (or rather Zoodle) will begin showing real articles rather than propaganda. These articles can actually be clicked and read if so desired. 
To finish the experience, I decided that the best way was for the user to be caught at the end, thus showing concretely, that the country’s authority does not want the player, a common person, to see the truth.

This format of project seemed like a good way of using various libraries and programming concepts that we have learned in the semester, as different pages can have different things happening, rather than cramming all concepts and libraries into a one screen game.
