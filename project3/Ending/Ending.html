<p>This was an interactive experience meant to simulate the censorship of the internet in Eastern countries, namely China. Although the experience is heavily simplified and abstracted, and many of the websites meant to mimic Western websites, many of the themes are very much present in real life. Communication is extremely limited and any criticism of the country's authority are removed public viewing, as well as facts about global crises twisted, done so to make the country look more favorable.
