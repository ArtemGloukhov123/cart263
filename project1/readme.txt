Sisyphus is well known as the man in Greek mythology who was condemned to push a large boulder up a hill, but failing as he reaches the top, having the boulder roll all the way down and having to start all over again. I wanted to take this concept of having to do a menial task over and over and not getting anywhere, and apply it to a real-life situation. I decided to make an interactive experience of a sweatshop worker, working for a wealthy company, however not being able to make enough money to feed their family. I decided to make this game about these workers as they are forced to perform repetitive tasks all day long, under less than favorable conditions, often only making a few dollars a day, and not being able to get out of this job, or seek a better one.

In this game, you play as a sweatshop worker, working for Banana™, assembling their latest smartphones, and shipping them out to be sold in the West. You earn a measly 0.01$ per phone assembled and are trying to make enough money to feed your poor, starving family. Unfortunately, sometimes complications in shipment can happen, and it is you who gets punished for it.

The player receives modules on a conveyor belt that they must install onto the motherboard on their table by dragging them with the mouse. When all four modules are assembled, the phone is placed into the box beside them to be shipped. Another phone motherboard is given to the player and the process continues. Each phone shipped earns the player 0.01$. Food for the player’s family can be bought for 0.05$
