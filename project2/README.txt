James Bridle’s article focuses on the phenomenon of children’s videos on YouTube. Usually, these videos get put on by parents and the children left to watch, hours on end, while the YouTube algorithm finds the net video for the child to auto-play. Perhaps also, the child has learned to find these videos for themselves, in which case these video creators need to make a title that includes every possible keyword that a child might search for, something along the lines of “Spiderman Elsa Learn Colors Rhymes Games Slime Play-Doh Fun With Friends Finger Family Peppa Pig”. Since the children watching these videos aren’t quite developed enough to see past the off-brand fake Peppa Pig videos, the creators of these usually use bots to grind out video after video, simply swapping out elements, assets, sounds, etc. Swap out Spider-Man for Shrek, change the background, and generate a new algorithm-feeding title, and you have a brand-new video to be found by children and watched for hours, while you rack in your hardly hard-earned cash.
I wanted to recreate this sort of bot-generated content, so I made a program that generates a never-ending story for kids to listen to. The program selects a name for the hero of the story and their companion and sets them out for adventure, while a floating head of a woman (presumably the UK English Female we have come to know) reads out the story. The first three sentences are always the same, introducing the hero, his name, his town of origin, his companion, and their name as well. The sentences that follow are randomly selected from a list of sentences that are missing key words, namely nouns, verbs and adjectives (very similar to mad libs). Once it comes to one of these blanks, the program selects a random word from a large array of words corresponding to the type of word missing in the blank (noun, verb, adjective). 
The story being told is often times quite messy and nonsensical due to the vast variety of possible words to be chosen to make the sentence. This, in my view, is not a negative as this somewhat reflects the quality of videos being made for the children on YouTube. Does is make sense for Elsa from Frozen to be fighting the Joker from Bat-Man? Probably not, but the kids don’t seem to mind. 
So sit your child in front of the screen, click the “Tell Me a Story” button, and let them listen to this garbage pile of a story for hours on end, while they attempt to learn to read and an odd, uncanny floating head reads to them.
